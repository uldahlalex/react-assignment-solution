# Assignment: The Hospital App

# Rules

- You may help each other, but I recommend solving the assignment on your own
- It is not an assignment you have to "submit", but we have "product showcases" next Monday just before we start building server applications with C#.
- It is not mandatory to show your application, but I strongly recommend to do so: It can be a great learning opportunity to present your work to stakeholder/colleagues (and flex on others).
- The student with my favorite implementation gets a üéÅmystery prizeüéÅ (only students who do a showcase will be eligible to enter competition)

## Starting point:

You can clone this recommended startup boilerplate including the backend program neede like this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uldahlalex/react-assignment
```
The "client" folder contains relevant dependencies and configuration for the frontend. 
You are also free to build the client app completely from scratch if you prefer.

## How to start the backend
Have docker daemon running (you can check if you get an error when running 'docker ps' ).
From the "postgrest" directory in this project, run:
```bash
docker compose up
```
When the backend runs, you should be able to go to http://localhost:3001 and see the Swagger UI documentation page for the backend REST API HTTP Server.

You can also open up the Postgres Database manually using Datagrip / whatever other Database browser if you would like to. 
It runs on localhost:5432 and requires the credentials listed in docker-compose.yml (username "testuser" password "testpass" and databasename "testdb")

### How to reset data in backend

If you have made some changes in the database data, and you want to "go back" to the starting point, you can use:

(from the "postgrest" directory):
```bash
docker-compose down
docker volume rm postgrest_dbdata
docker-compose up
```

# Requirements

## Minimum requirements (FULL crud for single entity):
- ‚úÖ It should be possible to get an overview of all patients when navigating to /patients.
- Check: It should be possible get all data for a singular patient when navigating to /patients/:id where ID is the patient ID
- Check: It should be possible to enroll a new patient (create)
- Check: It should be possible to delete a patient
- It should be possible to change the name of a patient
- It should be possible to add new diagnoses to a patient
- The client application should be deployed to Firebase. If the backend is running locally, opening the deployment should still work with the local backend.

## Bonus requirements
- It should be possible to create a new disease which patients may be diagnosed with
- It should be possible to add a new diagnosis to a patient
- It should be possible to add new diseases

## Hard bonus requirements
- In the patients feed overview (all patients), a number next to the patient name should indicate the number of diagnosis for the patient (hint: It's possible to "join" tables when querying postgREST)
- The overview of patients should be paginated such that the page only shows the first X patients
- It should be possible to search for patients and diseases
- Whatever other feature you think will be cool to have!


## Relevant documentation for using the backend:
The backend is built with postgREST which is a REST tool on top of a PostgreSQL database.
The reference API for querying the "tables" can be found here: https://docs.postgrest.org/en/v12/references/api/tables_views.html
